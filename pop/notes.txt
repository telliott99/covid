Estimated population from:

https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html

gives 

co-est2019-annres.csv

Open Numbers
then look for file and open that, it will convert

It looks like the screenshot

Then convert to csv
saved under the same filename by mistake 

Process with script to pop.csv

Last column is 2019 population
First column is ".county, state"

There are a number of issues that are cleaned up.
See extract_pop.py

In addition, some places in the Covid-19 database
do not have entries in the population database
b/c they are not really official counties

I put estimates for their populations in 'extra.txt'.

Dona Ana is actually a Unicode issue with the tilde
'Do\xc3\xb1a Ana;New Mexico'
