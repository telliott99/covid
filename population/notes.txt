Estimated population from:

https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html

gives 

co-est2019-annres.csv

Open Numbers
then look for file and open that, it will convert

It looks like the screenshot

Then convert to csv
saved under the same filename by mistake 

Process with script to pop.csv

Last column is 2019 population
First column is ".county, state"

There are a number of issues that are cleaned up.
See extract_pop.py

#-----

Some counties in the Covid-19 database
do not have entries in the population database
b/c they are not really official counties

I put estimates for their populations in 'extra.txt'.

Soldotna;Alaska,4689
Sterling;Alaska,5617
Desoto;Florida,38001
Dukes and Nantucket;Massachusetts,16535
Carson City;Nevada,55274
Dona Ana;New Mexico,218195
Central Utah;Utah,613
Charles City;Virginia,133

Dona Ana is actually a Unicode issue with the tilde
'Do\xc3\xb1a Ana;New Mexico'

So I guess the problem is the population data might combine Baltimore County and Baltimore City.  Let's check wikipedia:

County:  827,370
City:    593,490

My data lists the county and the city (I missed the city at first b/c lowercase).


Just add to extra:

Baltimore City;Maryland,593490
St. Louis City;Missouri,
New York City;New York,
Bear River;Utah,
Southwest Utah;Utah,
Weber-Morgan;Utah,
Fairfax City;Virginia,
Franklin City;Virginia,
Richmond City;Virginia,
Roanoke City;Virginia,

Three more:

Kansas City;Missouri


Utah is hard:  29 counties some are joined

populations:

Davis
Salt Lake
Summit
Toele
Wasatch
San Juan

Bear River:  Box Elder, Cache, Rich
             56046 + 128289 + 2483 = 186818

Weber-Morgan 260213 + 12124 = 272337

Utah:    Juab, Millard, Utah
         12017 + 13188 + 636235 = 661440

SW:      Beaver, Iron, Washington
         6710 + 54839 + 177556 = 239105

Central: Garfield, Kane, Piute, Sanpete,Sevier,Wayne
         5051 + 7886 + 1479 + 30929 + 21620 + 2711 = 69676

SE:      Carbon,Emery,Grand  
         20463 + 10012 + 9754 = 40229

Tri:     Daggett, Duchesne, Uintah
         950 + 19938 + 35734 = 56622
