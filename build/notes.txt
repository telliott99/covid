At some point, for some countries, reports have changed from reporting by the whole country, instead breaking it down by district.  

For example with the db.max.txt up to 06-28, there are 99 entries for ;;;Brazil.  The last 41 are identical.  That suggests that around May 20, reporting changed.  

2020-05-19 is the last day that the csv file lists cases for ,,,Brazil, with 271885.  It has stayed the same since.  That key disappears from the csv file, but when that happens we keep the total from the previous day, ad infinitum).  In the database, Brazil stays constant at 271885.

On 2020-05-20, all the districts for Brazil first appear.

The total for Brazil should be the total for all keys ;____;;Brazil, including ;;;Brazil.

A similar thing happened for Germany, except it was 46 entries previous.
For Italy, except it was 47 entries previous.
