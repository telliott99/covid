This is all Python2 code.
At some point, if we just convert print 'x' to print('x') Python3 should work.

python update.py

will construct the db (if necessary) or update it

Don't forget to call

python fixit.py

Then db to the parent directory.

Today I decided to split out the db code into a separate directory.  Since I do not want to duplicate or split the util.py module, I added this to those files in this directory that need util functions:

from util_path import util as ut

util_path.py
import imp
util = imp.load_source('util', '/Users/telliott/Github/covid/util.py')

This fix is Python2 specific.

The second change is to use ints for the database values.  The original data files have '-' when data is missing.  I've been working with data as strings and only converting to ints for calculations.  It's a pain.  So from now on we will treat '-' as 0, and use strings only when formatting for output.
